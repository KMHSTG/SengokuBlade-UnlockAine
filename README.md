# **Sengoku Blade - Unlock Aine**

These patches will unlock Aine to be easily selectable, in the Sengoku Blade and Tengai MAME roms. They have no other effect. To select Aine, hit "up" once on the random square of the character select screen.

## Patching Instructions:

1 - Extract your MAME Sengoku Blade (tengaij.zip) or Tengai (tengai.zip) rom archive.

2 - Using your xdelta patcher of choice, apply the xdelta patch matching your rom. The Sengoku Blade patch should be applied to the file named "3-u41.bin". And if patching Tengai, that patch should be applied to "5-u40.bin". Make sure that your patched file has the same filename as the original.

3 - Rezip the Sengoku Blade or Tengai rom archive.
  
  
##### NOTE: When you start up the patched rom, MAME will complain about wrong checksum. This is expected, and can be safely ignored. If necessary, the patching process can be verified using the hashes below:
